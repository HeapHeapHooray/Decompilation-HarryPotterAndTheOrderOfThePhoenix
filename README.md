### An attempt to decompile the game Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix using Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity.

## Currently shows a Window ! 🥳
### NOTE: The meaty stuff seems to be at what's ommited in sub_60dc10 and sub_636830, we'll get to 100 non-stub functions then see what's there !
### Total functions in `hp.exe`: 12,295 (as analyzed by Ghidra)
### Current decompiled functions: 57
# Dependencies
### Zig for cross-compiling from Linux to Windows, you can just use your compiler of choice if you are on Windows.

# Usage
### 1. Go to https://oldgamesdownload.com/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-eks/ and download Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_Win_Preinstalled_EN.zip (3.57GB).
### 2. Clone the repository.
### 3. Put hp.exe from the downloaded zip into the newly cloned repository.
### 4. Use Gemini CLI inside the repository, or open the project in Google Antigravity.
### 5. Ask Gemini to follow the instructions in GEMINI-INSTRUCTIONS.txt (Make sure you use Gemini 3 😉)
